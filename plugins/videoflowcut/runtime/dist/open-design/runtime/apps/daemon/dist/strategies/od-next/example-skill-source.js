/**
 * Resolve the project's official example card to a capture source, or null.
 *
 * The invariant this exists to hold: **an example card never changes the
 * route.** Picking one is a more specific choice inside a task type OD Next
 * already owns, not a claim on the strategy, so the card rides along in
 * `session_skills/user_selected_skills` instead of pinning a plugin. Capture
 * itself happens in `captureOdNextSessionSkillPackage`, because a task freezes
 * ONE package across every channel the session selected material through.
 *
 * It is deliberately fail-soft. Every reason resolution can fail — the example
 * was uninstalled, its manifest moved on from the digest the project pinned,
 * the folder is unreadable — is a reason to run this task without the example,
 * never a reason to fail the user's run or to divert it off the automatic
 * route it already qualified for. Failures are warned about, then swallowed,
 * and null means "run without the card".
